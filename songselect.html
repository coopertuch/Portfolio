                  Henry, 25, is a music producer and DJ in Los Angeles. He uses
                  his iPhone to play music during any commute, but primarily
                  uses digital audio workspaces, DJ software, and streaming
                  services on his personal desktop. He describes, “My main
                  priority is producing, and I’m tired of spending hours
                  downloading files from countless websites and organizing my
                  library. I’m a DJ at various local bars too, so having access
                  to top songs and stems for my own shows is essential. My
                  laptop is constantly out of storage, so I also need a platform
                  to store my files on the cloud. If I’m not producing and on
                  the move, I’ll be on my phone searching for new music on
                  Spotify, SoundCloud, or BeatPort.” Henry needs a platform to
                  manage and store all of his songs, stems, and synths for his
                  production and DJ events, using a familiar interface that is
                  capable of comprehensive sorting and filtering.
