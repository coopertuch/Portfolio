                  John, 18, is attending University in New York City. While he
                  uses his desktop for studying, John is frequently using his
                  iPhone for social media, listening to podcasts, and mobile
                  gaming. He explains, “I’m still getting adjusted to living in
                  the city and I’m having difficulty finding time to relax with
                  my busy school schedule. I’m constantly using my bullet
                  journal to track progression for my goals and activities. I
                  have some experience meditating, and I often switch between
                  guided and unguided sessions that I find online.” John needs a
                  mobile application that will allow him to easily access
                  customizable meditation sessions, with statistics that pair
                  well with his habit tracking. He’s not interested in new
                  content or constant updates, he simply wants a meditation
                  option that will fit his mood and schedule.
