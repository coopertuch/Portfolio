            My career journey has taken me across disciplines, from media
            planning, to software engineering, and finally to user experience.
            While my interest in technology and psychology sent me towards
            digital marketing, I knew that I still wanted more in the tech
            space.
            <br /><br />There was a feeling of necessity to start contributing
            to the projects that have been foundational to many of my own
            passions, which led me to software engineering. Working as a
            frontend developer at a startup, my role focused on coding
            responsive web pages, but was broad enough to include user research,
            data analysis, and journey mapping, processes that I'm already very
            comfortable with.<br /><br />
            This position introduced me to what is formally known as UX research
            and design; paired with web development and media planning, user
            experience proved to be the perfect intersection of my skills and
            passions. My focus now is to build intuitive software that supports
            any number of digital creators, aspiring musicians, relentless
            academics, design fanatics, game players, health advocates, and
            world travelers.
            <br /><br />Fun Facts: I’ve completed 75+ escape rooms, solo
            traveled across North America, Europe, and Asia chasing food and
            music, and I’m passionate about DJing.
