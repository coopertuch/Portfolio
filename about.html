            Having graduated California State University, Fullerton with a
            degree in Business Marketing, I began work as a Media Planner at a
            Digital Marketing Agency in 2018. While I enjoyed user research,
            data analysis, curating ads, and designing user flow to drive
            conversions, the desire to build the digital products that I was
            advertising grew.<br /><br />
            This led me to the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive
            program in 2019, where I learned Full Stack Web Development. I’m
            captivated by these technologies, and it was essential that I
            understood how the code that dictates how I interact with software
            works.<br /><br />
            Following GA, I worked as a Frontend Developer, designing and
            building websites in 2020. Using a combination of skills from Media
            Planning and Web Development for these projects, I was able to
            discover the role that would prove to be a perfect intersection of
            my experiences - UX Research & Design.<br /><br />
            I’m excited now to work on projects and build products for any of
            the industries that are important to me, including music, education,
            travel, food, fitness, nutrition, and health. Fun Facts: I’ve
            completed 75+ escape rooms, solo traveled across North America,
            Europe, and Asia chasing food and music, and I’m passionate about
            DJing.
