            My career journey has taken me across disciplines, from media
            planning to software engineering. While I got a taste of fusing my
            dual passions in psychology and technology in digital marketing, I
            knew I wanted to take it a step further and pursue a career in tech
            to create powerful tools and intuitive experiences for industries I
            admire.
            <br /><br />
            My media planning experience reinforced the importance of research,
            from user demographics and behavior to understanding the specific
            business and industry. Starting with a thorough review of the
            client, we would analyze and build upon existing campaigns,
            incorporating feedback, A/B testing, and analytics.
            <br /><br />
            It was crucial to grasp the entire user journey in order to escort
            potential customers from awareness, to consideration, to conversion.
            These ads had to match and accentuate the brand’s style of copy and
            design to facilitate users transitioning seamlessly from ad to
            landing page; more than anything, the users' interaction with the
            ads needed to feel effortless, even enjoyable.
            <br /><br />
            With software engineering, the focus became building features that
            achieve specific goals. From pseudocoding, to wireframing, to
            prototyping, the planning phase was critical for setting a solid
            foundation for any project; it had to ensure that the features were
            technically feasible, the design style matched the client or theme,
            and required mapping the entire journey for users.
            <br /><br />
            Through the development process, it’s essential to be aware of best
            practices, prioritize the mvp, and constantly clean code,
            reiterating over any elements that could be improved. Before
            delivering a product, I always emphasized usability testing, as it
            allowed me to uncover any issues, gather feedback, and ensure they
            are able to deliver a fully functional web application. I’m eager
            now to use these skills to build the next generation of software
            that supports music, health, and productivity.
