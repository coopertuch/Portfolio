            My career journey has taken me across disciplines, from media
            planning, to software engineering, and finally to user experience.
            While I got a taste of fusing my dual passion in psychology and
            technology in digital marketing, I knew I wanted to take it a step
            further and pursue a career in tech to create powerful tools and
            intuitive experiences for industries I admire.
            <br /><br />
            To start, media planning reinforced the importance of research, from
            user demographics and behavior to understanding the specific
            business and industry. Starting with a thorough review of the
            client, we would analyze and build upon existing campaigns,
            incorporating internal and external feedback, A/B testing, and
            analytics.
            <br /><br />
            Curating ad funnels, it was crucial to grasp the entire user journey
            in order to escort potential customers from awareness, to
            consideration, to conversion. These ads had to match and accentuate
            the brand’s style of copy and design to facilitate users
            transitioning seamlessly from ad to landing page; more than
            anything, the users' interaction with the ads needed to feel
            effortless, even enjoyable.
            <br /><br />
            Switching to software engineering, the focus became building
            features that will achieve specific goals. From pseudocoding, to
            wireframing, to prototyping, the planning phase is critical for
            setting a solid foundation for any project; it has to ensure that
            the features are technically feasible, the design style matches the
            client or theme, and requires mapping the entire journey for users.
            <br /><br />
            Through the development process, it’s essential to be aware of best
            practices, prioritize the mvp, and constantly clean code,
            reiterating over any elements that can be improved. To finish,
            usability testing allows developers to uncover any issues, gather
            feedback, and ensure they are able to deliver a fully functional web
            application.
            <br /><br />
            The culmination of these experiences encapsulates the essential
            qualities of a UX researcher and designer, and I’m eager now to use
            these skills building the next generation of software that supports
            music, health, and productivity. Fun Facts: I’ve completed 75+
            escape rooms, solo traveled across North America, Europe, and Asia
            chasing food and music, and I’m passionate about DJing.
