            My career journey has taken me across disciplines, from media
            planning, to software engineering, and finally to user experience.
            While I got a taste of fusing my dual passion in psychology and
            technology in digital marketing, I knew I wanted to take it a step
            further and pursue a career in tech to create powerful tools and
            intuitive experiences for communities I admire.
            <br /><br />There was a feeling of necessity to start contributing
            to the projects that have been foundational to many of my own
            passions, which led me to software engineering. Working as a
            frontend developer at a startup, my role focused on coding
            responsive web pages, but was broad enough to include user research,
            data analysis, and journey mapping, processes that I'm already very
            comfortable with.<br /><br />
            This position introduced me to UX research and design; paired with
            web development and media planning, user experience proved to be the
            perfect intersection of my skills and passions. My focus now is to
            build intuitive software that supports any number of digital
            creators, aspiring musicians, relentless academics, design fanatics,
            game players, health advocates, and world travelers.
            <br /><br />Fun Facts: I’ve completed 75+ escape rooms, solo
            traveled across North America, Europe, and Asia chasing food and
            music, and I’m passionate about DJing.
