          is a collection of questions split into various categories. This
          project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is intended for
          use by new friends, old friends, family, anyone you hope to get closer
          to or have some fun with. So often we are paralyzed by social
          interactions and overthinking that we don't even begin to converse
          with each other, always resorting to small talk; I've been doing well,
          the weather is good, so was my weekend. While you may not want to get
          into personal details with co-workers, this project offers a variety
          of (growing) categories and questions to spark up conversations with
          each other; spend some time debating whether savory or sweet is
          better, or maybe come to the realization that you both love the same
          movies. For those who seek to enrich or rebuild existing relationships
          with friends or family, there are even more questions for you.
          Sometimes all it takes is one question to start meaningful
          conversations and open the door to connection. Check out the GitHub
          repository
