              is a collection of questions split into various categories. This
              project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is intended
              for use by new friends, old friends, family, anyone you hope to
              get closer to or have some fun with. So often we are paralyzed by
              social interactions and overthinking that we don't even begin to
              converse with each other, always resorting to small talk; I've
              been doing well, the weather is good, so was my weekend. While you
              may not want to get into personal details with co-workers, this
              project offers a variety of (growing) categories and questions to
              spark up conversations with each other; spend some time debating
              whether savory or sweet is better, or maybe come to the
              realization that you both love the same movies. For those who seek
              to enrich or rebuild existing relationships with friends or
              family, there are even more questions for you. Sometimes all it
              takes is one question to start meaningful conversations and open
              the door to connection. A huge thank you to the Banana Boyz, or
              "BB'z" for short, for inspiring this app idea! Check out the
