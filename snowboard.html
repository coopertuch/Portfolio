                  Sally, 28, works as a corporate employee in Los Angeles. She’s
                  constantly using her iPhone to keep in touch with co-workers
                  and friends, read the news, and shop online. She shares, “I’m
                  new to snowboarding but I’m excited to continue learning and
                  improving. I drive up to the mountains on my free weekends,
                  but don’t have much time to dedicate to boarding outside of
                  that. I’m interested in purchasing my own gear now, but my
                  knowledge of snowboarding equipment is minimal, so package
                  options with informative descriptions is important to me.
                  Looking good is equally important, so I want access to the
                  latest styles and trends as well.” Sally needs a descriptive
                  e-commerce website that showcases popular collections. The
                  website should also be sleek and intuitive, careful not to
                  sacrifice legibility and a seamless purchasing experience with
                  pop-ups, excessive banners, or too many board options.
