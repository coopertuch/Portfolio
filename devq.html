          is a study platform for Software Engineers, built as a collaborative
          project at General Assembly using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
          Express, Node, Mongoose, GitHub, Heroku. Users can route to the home
          page clicking on "DevQ", to the add new question page with "Q+", and
          the about page with "About". The body consists of links to various
          categories of questions, which will then take users to the question
          page; the question page will dynamically fill with questions matching
          that type, with an input to note their answer, a hint, an answer, and
          a link to an addtional resource for continued reading. On this page,
          users can choose to edit the question, which will direct them to the
          edit page; on the edit page, users will then re-enter the information
          for the question with any edits they wish to make, with the option to
          delete the question altogether. To create new questions, users can
          click on the "Q+", which will direct them to the new question page. On
          this page, users will enter the question, hint, answer, a link to
          additional resources, and question type, with all inputs being
          required. Submitting the question will push them to the database,
          where they will then be requested and displayed in their respective
          category types when the user goes back to questions. For more
          information on the project with examples, check out the GitHub
