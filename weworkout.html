              is an open forum for finding workouts, adding your own workouts,
              and a database to track your weights, reps, sets, and progression,
              built using HTML, CSS, Python, Django, PostgreSQL and Materialize.
              There is full CRUD functionality for workouts and lifts, with
              required user authentication. WeWorkout is deployed to Heroku, and
              is responsive for desktop and mobile. On the Home/Workout page,
              workouts are listed with the user's name and muscle group,
              followed by form, breathing, and progression tips; users can add
              workouts from this page using the + sign. Clicking into a workout
              will then display all lifts associated with that user's muscle
              group, with the exercise, desired reps, and weight; users can add
              lifts from this page using the + sign, in addition to being able
              to edit and delete both the workout and lift info from this page.
              The Lifts page will display all lifts, where users can click on
              lifts to view, edit, or delete. To add, edit, or delete workouts
              and lifts, users must sign up and be logged in; users do not need
              to be logged in to just view workouts and lifts. For more
              information on the project with examples, check out the GitHub
              repository

                  This application is made for both new and experienced lifters
                  alike! As a newcomer, view full workouts and lifts from a
                  variety of other users, alongside tips for form, breathing,
                  and progression, important factors that are often overlooked
                  in weightlifting. If you've already mastered form and a
                  variety of lifts, the next step is tracking. WeWorkout
                  provides a neat platform to store your weights, reps, and
                  sets, information that is vital to monitor progression. As a
                  whole, WeWorkout is a simple guide and log catered to anyone
                  who wants to lift weights!
