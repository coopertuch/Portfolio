          is an open forum for finding workouts, adding your own workouts, and a
          database to track your weights, reps, sets, and progression, built
          using HTML, CSS, Python, Django, PostgreSQL and Materialize. There is
          full CRUD functionality for workouts and lifts, with required user
          authentication. WeWorkout is deployed to Heroku, and is responsive for
          desktop and mobile. On the Home/Workout page, workouts are listed with
          the user's name and muscle group, followed by form, breathing, and
          progression tips; users can add workouts from this page using the +
          sign. Clicking into a workout will then display all lifts associated
          with that user's muscle group, with the exercise, desired reps, and
          weight; users can add lifts from this page using the + sign, in
          addition to being able to edit and delete both the workout and lift
          info from this page. The Lifts page will display all lifts, where
          users can click on lifts to view, edit, or delete. To add, edit, or
          delete workouts and lifts, users must sign up and be logged in; users
          do not need to be logged in to just view workouts and lifts. For more
          information on the project with examples, check out the GitHub
          repository
